# Nice To Meet You

The purpose of this website if most importantly teaching me the skill 
to learn the practical application of creating a website from the 
ground up. By learning to build a website from the ground up, I will 
have the foundational skills needed to build a quality digital portfolio 
that I can showcase my digital works to future job prospects.

This webpage will serve as a basis for a future bio section of my digital
portfolio.
