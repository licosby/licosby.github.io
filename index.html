    <h1>Lindsey Cosby</h1>
    <h2>I'm getting a double Bachelor's degree in Computing Applications and Human Centered AI.</h2>
    <p> My goals for this course are to learn the tools I need so that I have the best prospects for <br>
        career placement after graduation. I don't want to just work somewhere. I want to find a company <br>
        that values my skills and that I feel I am an asset to them as well. <br>
    <p> After graduation my goal is to be able to have a job that I am financially stable enough that my<br>
        husband can retire and that we might get to move to somewhere cold. In our current financial situation <br>
        we don't have a lot of extra income to do things like going on trips or even just grocery shopping without<br>
        a list. My ultimate goal is to do my absolute best in my courses so that I can get off disability and rejoin <br>
        the work force so I feel more stable in mine and my families future .</p>
