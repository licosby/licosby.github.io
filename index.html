    <p> My goal in Fundamentals of Computing Application is to complete the course with the skills I need to progress through
        the rest of the Computing Applications program at Texas Tech. Upon completion of my degree, I hope to join a company
        that I can grow with and also appreciates the value that my skills benefit their company. One that hopefully is located
        in cold weather.</p>
    <p>I would enjoy being in a position that allowed me to combine my creativity and technical skills to make digital products
        that are not just useful but are attractive and user-friendly. I want to provide the highest level of quality to any project
        I work on.</p></p>
