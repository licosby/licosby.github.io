# **All About Me**


### **Project Purpose**

* The purpose of this project is to use the skills I have been learning into practice.
* To be able to make a visually appealing design as well as the proper way to format
my coding so that others may be able to read it and update it when necessary.


### **Description**

* This project puts into practice the foundational skills I have learned for 
building a web-site from the ground up.
* To learn the skills that I need to be able to have the ability to have 
complete creative freedom over my website and not being limited to the 
generic template designs that people.


### **Desired Results**

1.  A website that reflects my personality and creative style
2.  A website that I can build on to use as a digital portfolio to showcase 
my skills to a future employer or company
3.  A website that is pleasing to view, read, and navigate without looking
generic.


### **Exclusions (out-of-scope)**

* Animations- these take more skill than I currently have time for this project.
* Branding and Logos. I currently do not have any in mind that I would like to include.
* Social Media links for Facebook, TikTok, or Instagram. I do not have them set up to be
valid for this website.
